# Woo Donation Calculate

A simple donation calculator for your woocommerce store.

You can add a percent amount from your product editor in backend. 

You can choose to calculate the donation amount singular on product or per item based (donation amount will be changed once item quantity is changed).

Your customer will see a notification in the product detail page: `If you order this product **amount** will be donated`

You can select organisation to send the donation to go. If selected from the drop down the notification message will change to `If you order this product **amount** will be donated to **organisation name**`

You can inset/delete organisation from the dashboard. For this you need to your admin panel then Settings > Woo Donation Organisation sub menu

Your customer will see the notification in the cart and checkout page along with the product subtotal.
